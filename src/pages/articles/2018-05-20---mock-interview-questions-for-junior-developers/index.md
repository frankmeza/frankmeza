# Setup the scenario
- you got the interview
- yay!
- now what?
- which algorithm to study?
- which project to showcase?
- which languages to put to the front of your knowledge?

## Think again
- frameworks change
- but can you learn/work with a new one?
- how can you prove this? with a solid grasp of basic concepts
- what are these "basic concepts?" 

### REST? The idea
### http? The acronym
- the protocol
- client, server relationship 
- verbs
- Status codes http
- Parts of a response from http verb
- JSON, keys and values
- other data

### What are the clients that will use server data?
- web browser, mobile device
- what will the client do with the data?
- Types of server data - XML?, JSON, HTML

### Which Languages, frameworks do you know and work with? Rate yourself 1-10
- Describe parts of a JS function
- function name
- params
- function body
- return statement, value, possibly void/undefined

### Variable and function scope in JS
- const, let, var (hoisted) in closures and function scope
- const/let do not leave their block { }

#### What is closure?

#### Call, bind, apply in JS

### describe JS objects -
- Key/values
- Usually string as key

### Technical part of interview/whiteboarding

- Whiteboard - small algorithm - input int, output string of square

```
const square = (input) {
    const line = "";
    for (let i=0; i >= input; i++) {
        line.concat("x")
    }

    for (let i=0; i >= input; i++) {
        console.log(line + \n)
    }
}
```

#### Talk through it...?
Offer to be Google, or allow Google to be used
Plain English answer for help if necessary

### Web development basics - 
http, verbs, response, request, REST what and why, status codes, 

### CSS selectors - 

React - props, state, parts of react app, jsx

Function - name, params, body block

Variable scope within and without blocks { }

Whiteboard- talk through all requirements, and pseudo code talk through your plan THEN begin coding.
