# What I'm into right now

## In the Physical World

I watched some videos on burpies and how they are a total body workout. I cooked up a work-out recipe for the next month of public safety lockdown, I miss jiujitsu a lot üò¢

## Code Exploration

I have a [personal project](https://github.com/frankmeza/tap_list) that I've been having a good time updating and thinking up new features for. I decided to create a new tech stack for myself, amongst many many choices... Here they are:

### Server

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - the choice for a new generation‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
- [Actix](https://actix.rs/) - web framework for Rust

### Web Client

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - I ‚ù§Ô∏è Typescript.
- [SvelteJS](https://www.svelte.dev) - React ain't gonna live forever...

### Mobile Client (Under Very Heavy Consideration)

- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - I mean, I'll learn it if Flutter is gonna be hot shit. It would be cool 
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - ReactNative ain't gonna live forever...
