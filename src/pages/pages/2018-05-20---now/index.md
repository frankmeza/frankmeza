# What I'm into right now

## Rust

Rust keeps coming up on my radar lately, so I've been reading through [_The Book_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/2018-edition/foreword.html) and seeing what all the rage is. Check out my notes [here on Github](https://github.com/frankmeza/rust-notes)!

## Jiujitsu

I finally feel like my wind is back where it was before my vacation, when I gorged on all the wines, cheeses, and _paste√≠s de nata_, and all the other mainstays of Portuguese cuisine that I could fit in my mouth while in Lisbon in September. Next steps include fleshing out a solid procedure of steps for this sweep/throw thing that's been working for me a lot, lately. I've also thought of some Youtube type shit to try to spin out from it, some real acrobatic inverted type stuff. Wish me luck!

## Portuguese

After visiting Portugal and having a fairly difficult time decoding the local pronunciation, I have decided that some formal lessons are in order. I have an okay handle on the language itself, but IMO the broad Brazilian pronunciation had lulled me into thinking that I actually can speak the language...! (I pretty much can, although I don't always feel that way.)

## Sitka: Testing & Documentation

At Olio Apps, we have cooked up a Redux module manager, called [Sitka](https://github.com/olioapps/sitka). It's pretty cool so far! The underlying idea of Sitka is to use it to encapsulate business logic for a single module in a simple Typescript class while still maintaining awareness of related data shapes and events, via subscription. Essentially, Sitka acts as a wrapper for Redux and Redux-saga. In addition to helping document its use (while I use it in a client project), I would like to write unit tests against the core utilities.
