# What I'm into right now

Fresh from BuzzJS in incredible New York City, nourished by [Gerard Sans'](https://twitter.com/gerardsans/) GraphQL workshop and [Prosper Otemuyiwa](https://twitter.com/unicodeveloper/)'s talk on authorization and authentication, I'm a new rider on the GraphQL train.  

For the near future, I'll be setting up a GQL server and client at the same time that I'm pretending to try out my [_sotaque lisboeta_](https://www.vortexmag.net/10-formas-infaliveis-de-provar-a-um-lisboeta-que-ele-tambem-tem-sotaque/) before my trip to Lisbon at the end of summer.
