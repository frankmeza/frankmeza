# What I'm into right now

## Rust

Rust keeps coming up on my radar lately, so I've been reading through [_The Book_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/2018-edition/foreword.html) and seeing what all the rage is.

I've seen Rust often compared to Go in many respects and I thought I'd take a good long look at it.

I've found that learning two similar and/or related things within the same general time frame is a technique that has been successful for me in using one to shed light on the dark parts of one. Hopefully, this is another successful occasion.

After playing with both, I think that I will come away with two things: (1) a deeper understanding of each thanks in part to the other, and (2) a favorite for me to run with.

On to [Chapter 5.2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch05-02-example-structs.html)!
