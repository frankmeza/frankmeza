# What I'm into right now

## Rust, Actix, and SvelteJS

Yes folks, that's right. I have a [personal project](https://github.com/frankmeza/tap_list) in the works. It's been fun, especially the recent "every dependency gets an upgrade" party. Async all the things!  

Apart from that right now, long live the [dogecoin](https://dogecoin.com/) 🐕
