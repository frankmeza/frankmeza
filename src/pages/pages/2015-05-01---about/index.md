I think of my self as a good-natured smart-ass; nonchalant with a touch of rowdy.  

Just like you, I like stuff too. *Imagine that!* Besides writing code, I'm into:

- simplifying, organizing ideas, and decluttering stuff (all kinds of stuff)
- trying not to take myself too seriously
- spreading the gospel of yerba mate
- jiujitsu
- taking care of and stretching my body/joints 
- taking a deep breathe, taking in the moment, and saying out loud, "Ahh, this is nice!"
- planning my next overseas voyage (Portugal! I think, and soon!)
- instrumental music from around the world
- learning/speaking foreign languages (Indonesian, I'm looking at you)
- sunshine and warm weather
- eye contact, even with strangers (it doesn't have to be creepy, just smile)
- different sorts of nerdy history stuff (I blame my college degree)
