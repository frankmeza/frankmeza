I think of my self as a good-natured smart-ass; nonchalant with a touch of rowdy.

Besides writing code, I'm into:

- simplifying, organizing ideas, and decluttering stuff (all kinds of stuff)
- positive, fun, enjoyable social interactions of all types
- not taking myself too seriously
- Brazilian [jiujitsu](http://www.eastsidegrappling.com/)
- learning/speaking foreign languages (Spanish and Portuguese, primarily)
- a new curiosity about Mexico
- music from around the world
- taking a deep breathe, taking in the moment, and [saying out loud](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3172-and-i-urge-you-to-please-notice-when-you-are), "Ahh, this is nice!"
- spreading the gospel of [yerba mate](http://circleofdrink.com/adaptogenic-herbs-explained-reduce-stress-and-fight-disease) (check out the Yerba Mate favicon by Francielly Costa Senra)
- sunshine and warm weather
