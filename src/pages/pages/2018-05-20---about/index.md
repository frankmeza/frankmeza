I think of my self as a good-natured smart-ass; nonchalant with a touch of rowdy.  

Just like you, I like stuff. *Imagine that!* Besides writing code, I'm into:

- simplifying, organizing ideas, and decluttering stuff (all kinds of stuff)
- trying not to take myself too seriously
- spreading the gospel of [yerba mate](http://circleofdrink.com/adaptogenic-herbs-explained-reduce-stress-and-fight-disease)
- [jiujitsu](http://www.eastsidegrappling.com/)
- taking care of and stretching my body/joints 
- taking a deep breathe, taking in the moment, and [saying out loud](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3172-and-i-urge-you-to-please-notice-when-you-are), "Ahh, this is nice!"
- planning my next overseas voyage -> Portugal :booked:
- music from around the world
- learning/speaking foreign languages
- sunshine and warm weather
- eye contact, even with strangers (it doesn't have to be creepy, just smile)
- different sorts of nerdy history stuff (I blame my college degree)
