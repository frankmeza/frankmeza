YES!! Yes, it’s <strong>that</strong> job you <strong>really</strong> want. Hold on, this is really only step one. You still have to show up on time, know what the interviewers are asking you, demonstrate this knowledge clearly, smell good and maybe even smile a little bit before they grant you Github access to their greenfield codebase with all the newest new things you’ve been reading about at Hacker Noon between writing cover letters and filling out job applications.  </p>\\n<p>Okay, so now how to prep?</p>\\n<h2>Algorithms</h2>\\n<p>There’s a lot on the internet about nightmare algorithm questions in a job interview, but I’ve not heard anyone I personally know ever have to do this. However, I don’t see how this can hurt. If it does come up, it’s my general impression that it’s less important to get an algorithm ‘100% right’ than it is to thinking your way through it out loud to your interviewers, so that they can see how you think on your feet and under some slight pressure.  </p>\\n<h2>Personal Projects</h2>\\n<p>Do you have a project to showcase? Awesome! This is great. You may be asked to diagram a certain operation flow of your project or explain more about large, underlying concepts instead of tiny implementation details.  </p>\\n<h2>Language Diversity - Show, Don’t Tell</h2>\\n<p>Which programming languages are you going to put at the front of your knowledge? If you’re just entering the field and you’re after your first or even second job, this is much less applicable. If this is you, fear not - if in doubt about your ability, say something like “Given my current level of experience with code, I feel fairly comfortable with {language<em>of</em>choice}, but I’ll let you be the judge by asking me any questions about the language, or using that language to talk through concepts in programming.” This is what your interviewers are going to do anyway, but this sort of open statement lets them know that you are not trying to puff up your knowledge by dodging questions.</p>\\n<p>My first job in development was at a Rails/Backbone/CoffeScript shop, which was great for me at the time. When I began to learn programming, it was in Ruby. Because I didn’t have to adjust to new syntax right away, I was able to continue my learning of writing object-oriented code within such a widely known MVC framework as Rails in one seemingly unending streak of Ruby classes, and Rails controllers and serializers.  </p>\\n<p>Later, I grew an interest in both functional programming and typed languages. Although Ruby on Rails isn’t really the best space to take advantage of these types of approaches, I was still able to take <em>full</em> advantage of the fundamental concepts that I picked up during all that time programming within a Ruby/Rails environment.  </p>\\n<p>Shortly after, I began working with a small and tight team, whose primary stack is a mostly-functional and immutable approach to Typescript/React/React-Native/Go. This is obviously a very different tech stack than (mutable) object-oriented Rails/Backbone/CoffeeScript. However, I was able to leverage my experience with Ruby methods and objects and classes (as well as a few things in CoffeeScript) to learning to code using Javascript’s functional parts: <em>map</em>, <em>filter</em>, and <em>reduce</em> among them, as well as newer ES6 features such as the spread operator and fat arrow functions.  </p>\\n<h2>Think twice before going all-in on a single framework</h2>\\n<p>Yes, the job posting may have mentioned so-many-years-experience in such-and-such a framework, but we all know that frameworks serve different purposes in different types of businesses, and also go in and out of use.
